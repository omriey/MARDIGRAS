            <p> <img src="https://www.mardigrasneworleans.com/uploads/images/xmardigras-mayor-2019.jpg.pagespeed.ic.0ZitX568BS.webp"
                    alt="">As Mayor of the great City of New Orleans, I invite you to visit our
                city to experience the
                excitement of Mardi Gras!

                Mayor of New Orleans

                The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called
                Twelfth Night or
                Kings‚Äô Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event.

                Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private
                Carnival clubs,
                called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade goers. Visitors
                quickly learn to
                say, "Throw me something mister!"

                The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid
                & Pleasure Club and
                the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes add to the
                fun-filled day of excitement
                for revelers of all ages.

                New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place to
                be at any time of
                the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their lifetime. Make your
                plans now to be a part
                of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les bon temps rouler!"

                Sincerely,

                LaToya Cantrell
                Mayor of New Orleans </p>

            <h3> Mardi Gras Celebrations </h3>
            <p> <img src="/Images/info-page1.jpg" alt="mardi-gras-fun"> The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all
                of
                Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                Celebrations are
                concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
                (the start of lent in
                the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting);
                many days have
                several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the
                Mardi Gras season. In
                the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including
                parades and balls (some
                of them masquerade balls).

                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
                parade schedule and route
                each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
                Knights of Momus and
                the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
                events, such as the
                Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades),
                the Krewe of Bacchus
                (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure
                Club‚Äîa predominantly
                African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common
                throws are strings of
                colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive
                toys. Major krewes
                follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                originate in the Uptown and
                Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side
                of the French
                Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place
                downtown in the Faubourg
                Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally
                concludes with the
                "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>

            <h3> Mardi Gras History </h3>
            <p> <img src="/Images/CardWhip.jpg" alt=""> The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe,
                passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th
                and 18th
                centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or
                fatted calf,
                followed France to her colonies.

                On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot
                of ground 60
                miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was
                the eve of the
                festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702.
                In 1703, the
                tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.

                In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our
                current Mardi Gras
                krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711 through
                1861. The
                procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade
                with an actual
                bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.

                New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New
                Orleans, but not
                with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
                established elegant
                society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.

                The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                governing body. That
                year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and
                carnival organizations
                formed in New Orleans.

                By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to
                celebrate Mardi
                Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each event
                an exciting air
                of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking
                John Milton's
                hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling
                floats (known
                as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous. </p>

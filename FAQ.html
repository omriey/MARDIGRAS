        <h2>Welcome to Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) Pgae </h2>

        <div class="expand__cont">
            <h3 class="question__title"> Is there an "official" Mardi Gras? </h3>
            <p class="answer">No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do
                not believe the claims of
                businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the
                term ‚Äúofficial‚Äù is
                just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better. Products or
                websites are not
                licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its
                merchandise. In
                some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not
                true in New
                Orleans.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="expand__cont">
            <h3 class="question__title">What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack? </h3>
            <p class="answer">The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes
                it will change from one
                extreme to the other during the same day. It‚Äôs a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly morning
                may turn into a
                warm afternoon.

                Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat
                dirty. Don‚Äôt
                forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you‚Äôll definitely want to bring a
                raincoat!

        <div class="expand__cont">
            <h3 class="question__title"> I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during Mardi Gras?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer">The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This
                is the weekend when Bacchus
                and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New Orleans. The
                streets are packed all
                day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras)
                and Fat Tuesday
                are also great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night,
                and the Zulu
                Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of
                the costumes
                and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

        <div class="expand__cont">
            <h3 class="question__title"> How can I find out what this year's Mardi Gras theme will be?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer">There is not a single official Mardi Gras theme since there is no single organization
                in charge of Mardi Gras. Each
                parade krewe decides on its own theme each year, which is often kept secret until the parade. Their
                costumes, floats,
                some of their throws, and their "official" Mardi Gras poster (if they have one) reflect this theme.
                For example, after
                9/11, patriotic themes were popular.

                Most of the krewes are named after figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology, but some are
                named after the
                neighborhood where they parade.

        <div class="expand__cont">
            <h3 class="question__title"> Do I need to buy Mardi Gras beads and merchandise before my visit? </h3>
            <p class="answer">Not unless you are going to be a rider on a float. If you plan to watch the parades
                during
                Mardi Gras, you'll catch so
                much you won't be able to carry it all!

        <div class="expand__cont">
            <h3 class="question__title"> What happens if there is bad weather? </h3>
            <p class="answer">The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if the weather is
                predicted to be severe. The local TV
                and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour-by-hour updates.
